###  When to Get Help

ðŸ˜¢ *"I have no idea how to do this problem."* 

--

&amp;rarr; Ask us to point you to an similar example from the lecture, handouts, and guides.

--

&amp;rarr; Talk it through with someone on the Teaching Team so we can verbalize the process of going from Q to A.

--

ðŸ˜¡ *"I am getting a weird error but really think my code is correct/on the right track/matches the examples from class."*

--


&amp;rarr; It is time for a second pair of eyes.  Don't stare at the error for over 10 minutes.

--

ðŸ¤© And lots of other times too! ðŸ˜¬ 

---

###  When to Get Help


Remember:

&amp;rarr; Struggling is part of learning.

--

&amp;rarr; But let us help you ensure it is a **productive** struggle.

--

&amp;rarr; Struggling does NOT mean you are bad at stats!

## Data Collection


&lt;img src="img/twitter-study-design.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



---

##  Who are the data supposed to represent?

&lt;img src="img/week4.002.jpeg" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

**Key questions:**

+ What evidence is there that the data are **representative**?
+ Who is present?  Who is absent?
+ Who is overrepresented?  Who is underrepresented?

---

+ Who is overrepresented?  Who is underrepresented?

---

## Sampling Bias

&lt;img src="img/sampling.001.jpeg" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

**Sampling bias**: When the sampled units are **systematically different** from the non-sampled units on the variables of interest.

---

### Sampling Bias Example

The **Literary Digest** was a political magazine that correctly predicted the presidential outcomes from 1916 to 1932.  In 1936, they conducted the most extensive (to that date) public opinion poll.  They mailed questionnaires to over **10 million people** (about 1/3 of US households) whose names and addresses they obtained from telephone books and vehicle registration lists. 

--

**Population of Interest**:

&lt;br&gt;

**Sample**:

&lt;br&gt;



**Sampling bias**:


---

## Random Sampling

Use random sampling (a random mechanism for selecting cases from the population) to remove sampling bias.


#### Types of random sampling

* Simple random sampling

* Cluster sampling

* Stratified random sampling

* Systematic sampling

Why aren't all samples generated using simple random sampling?

### National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

&lt;br&gt;

Why are these data collected?

--

&amp;rarr; To assess the health of people in the US.

--

How are these data collected?

--

&amp;rarr; **Stage 1**: US is stratified by geography and distribution of minority populations.  Counties are randomly selected within each stratum.

--

&amp;rarr; **Stage 2**: From the sampled counties, city blocks are randomly selected. (City blocks are clusters.)

--

&amp;rarr; **Stage 3**: From sampled city blocks, households are randomly selected. (Household are clusters.)

--

&amp;rarr; **Stage 4**: From sampled households, people are randomly selected.  For the sampled households, a mobile health vehicle goes to the house and medical professionals take the necessary measurements.

--

**Why don't they use simple random sampling?**

## Detour: Data Ethics

---

### Data Ethics

&gt; "Good statistical practice is fundamentally based on transparent assumptions, reproducible results, and valid interpretations." -- Committee on Professional Ethics of the American Statistical Association (ASA)

--

The ASA have created ["Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice"](https://www.amstat.org/ASA/Your-Career/Ethical-Guidelines-for-Statistical-Practice.aspx)

--

&amp;rarr; These guidelines are for EVERYONE doing statistical work. 

--

&amp;rarr; There are ethical decisions at all steps of the Data Analysis Process.

--

&amp;rarr; We will periodically refer to specific guidelines throughout this class.

--

&gt; "Above all, professionalism in statistical practice presumes the goal of advancing knowledge while avoiding harm; using statistics in pursuit of unethical ends is inherently unethical."

---

class: , center, middle

##  Responsibilities to Research Subjects


&gt; "The ethical statistician protects and respects the rights and interests of human and animal subjects at all stages of their involvement in a project. This includes respondents to the census or to surveys, those whose data are contained in administrative records, and subjects of physically or psychologically invasive research."

---

###  Responsibilities to Research Subjects


&gt; "Protects the privacy and confidentiality of research subjects and data concerning them, whether obtained from the subjects directly, other persons, or existing records."

###  Who are the data supposed to represent?

---

###  Who are the data supposed to represent?

&lt;img src="img/week4.006.jpeg" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


**Key questions:**

+ What evidence is there that the **respondents** are **representative** of the **population**?
+ Who is present?  Who is absent?
+ Who is overrepresented?  Who is underrepresented?

---

## Nonresponse bias


&lt;img src="img/sampling.003.jpeg" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

**Nonresponse bias**: The respondents are **systematically** different from the non-respondents for the variables of interest.


---

### Come Back to Literary Digest Example

Of the 10 million people surveyed, more than 2.4 million responded with 57% indicating that they would vote for Republican Alf Landon in the upcoming presidential election instead of the current President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

&lt;br&gt;

**Non-response bias**?


---

## Tackling Nonresponse bias


&lt;img src="img/sampling.003.jpeg" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

&amp;rarr; Use **multiple modes** (mail, phone, in-person) and **multiple attempts** for reaching sampled cases.

--

&amp;rarr; Explore key demographic variables to see how respondents and non-respondents vary.

---

## Is Bigger Always Better?

--

&lt;img src="img/sampling.004.jpeg" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

For our **Literary Digest Example**, Gallup predicted Roosevelt would win based on a survey of **50,000** people, (instead of 2.4 million).

---

### Big Data Paradox


&lt;img src="img/meng.jpg" width="10%" style="float:left; padding:10px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

*"Without taking data quality into account, population inferences with Big Data are subject to a Big Data Paradox: the more the data, the surer we fool ourselves."* -- Xiao-Li Meng


--

**Example:** 

* During Spring of 2021, Delphi-Facebook estimated  vaccine uptake at 70% and U.S. Census estimated it at 67%.

--

* The CDC reported it to be 53%.

--

And, once we learn about **quantifying uncertainty**, we will see that large sample sizes produce very small measures of uncertainty.

--

*"If you have the resources, invest in data quality far more than you invest in data quantity. Bad-quality data is essentially wiping out the power you think you have. Thatâ€™s always been a problem, but itâ€™s magnified now because we have big data."* -- Xiao-Li Meng

---


## Thoughts on Data Collection: Sampling


**Random** sampling is important to ensure the sample is **representative** of the population.

--

Representativeness isn't about size.

+ Small random samples will tend to be more representative than large non-random samples.

--

But I bet most samples you will encounter won't have arisen from a random mechanism.


--

How do we draw conclusions about the population from **non-random samples**?

--

&amp;rarr; Determinee if your sampled cases (and respondents) are systematically different from the non-sampled cases (and non-respondents) for the variables you care about.

--

&amp;rarr; Adjust your population of interest.

--

&amp;rarr; Take a survey stats course to learn how to adjust the sample to make it more representative.


---

class: center, middle

## Now let's shift the discussion.

--

### Suppose we have our sample and have determined the population it represents.

--

### What kind of conclusions can we draw?


---

### Typical Analysis Goals

--

**Descriptive**: Want to estimate quantities related to the population.

&amp;rarr; *How many trees are in Alaska?*

--

**Predictive**: Want to predict the value of a variable.

&amp;rarr; *Can I use remotely sensed data to predict forest types in Alaska?*

--

**Causal**: Want to determine if changes in a variable cause changes in another variable.

&amp;rarr; *Are insects causing the increased mortality rates for pinyon-juniper woodlands?*


---

### Typical Analysis Goals


For these goals will differentiate between variables:

* **Response variable**: Variable I want to better understand

* **Explanatory/predictor variables**: Variables I think might explain/predict the response variable

--

&amp;rarr; *How many trees are in Alaska?*

&amp;rarr; *Can I use remotely sensed data to predict forest types in Alaska?*

&amp;rarr; *Are insects causing the increased mortality rates for pinyon-juniper woodlands?*

---

### Key Mechanism for Causal Goal


**Random assignment**: Cases are randomly assigned to categories of the **explanatory variable**

--

&amp;rarr; If the data were collected using **random assignment**, then I can determine if the explanatory variable **causes** changes in the response variable.

--

**Example**: [COVID Vaccine Trials](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/experimental-coronavirus-vaccine-highly-effective)

To study the effectiveness of the Moderna vaccine (mRNA-1273), researchers carried out a study on over 30,000 adult volunteers with no known previous COVID-19 infection.  Volunteers were randomly assigned to either receive two doses of the vaccine or two shots of saline.  The incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 was 94% lower in those who received the vaccine than those who did not.


--

**Why does random assignment allow us to conclude that this vaccine was effective at preventing (early strains of) COVID-19?**

---

## Causal Inference

Often want to conclude that an explanatory variable causes changes in a response variable but you did not randomly assign the explanatory variable.

--

**Confounding variable**: When the explanatory variable and response variable vary, so does the confounder.

&amp;rarr; Unclear if the explanatory variable or the confounder (or some other variable) is causing changes in the response.


&lt;img src="img/confound.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

## Causal Inference

Often want to conclude that an explanatory variable causes changes in a response variable but you did not randomly assign the explanatory variable.



**Confounding variable**: When the explanatory variable and response variable vary, so does the confounder.

&amp;rarr; Unclear if the explanatory variable or the confounder (or some other variable) is causing changes in the response.


&lt;img src="img/confound2.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Causal Inference

* **Spurious relationship**: Two variables are associated but not causally related
    + In the age of big data, lots of good examples [out there](https://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations).

--

&amp;rarr; *"Correlation does not imply causation."

--


&amp;rarr; *"Correlation does not imply not causation."*

--

* **Causal inference**: Methods for finding causal relationships even when the data were collected without random assignment.


---

## Types of Studies



**Experiment:** Interested in causal relationships so utilize random assignment.  Other key features include:

+ Control group
+ Placebo
+ Blinding

--

**Example**: COVID vaccine trials

--

+ Control group: Those who got no vaccine.

--

+ Placebo: The control group got saline shots so they didn't know their group.

--

+ Blinding: Subjects and researchers interacting with subjects did not know which group they were in.



---


## Types of Studies

**Observational Study:** Collect data in a way that doesn't interfere

--

**Example**: Hand washing study

To estimate what percent of people in the US wash their hands after using a public restroom, researchers pretended to comb their hair while observing 6000 people in public restrooms throughout the United States. They found that 85% of the people who were observed washed their hands after going to the bathroom.

---


## Thoughts on Data Collection: Goals

Consider your analysis goals when making conclusions.  If your goal is to show causal relationships, ask:

* Do I have convincing evidence that any differences in the response aren't just do to "random chance?"
* Do I have convincing evidence against the explanatory groups differing to begin with?

--

Random assignment allows you to explore **causal** relationships between your explanatory variables and the predictor variables because the randomization makes the explanatory groups roughly similar.

--

How do we draw causal conclusions from studies without random assignment?

--

&amp;rarr; With extreme care!  Try to control for all possible confounding variables.

--

&amp;rarr; Discuss the associations/correlations you found.  Use domain knowledge to address potentially causal links.

--

&amp;rarr; Take more stats to learn more about causal inference.


--

**Bottom Line:** We often have to use imperfect data to make decisions.
