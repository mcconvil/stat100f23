## Identity and the Classroom

* Acknowledge that my perspectives and experiences have shaped how I teach this course

--

* Some of my identities place me in dominant groups while others in marginalized groups


--


* Strive to bring examples and scholarly contributions that value knowledge from folks with a wide variety of identities


--

* Strive to be a open listener and recognize your thoughts as a generous offer and a vote of confidence in my ability to hear and be transformed by you

--

* Ask that you reflect on your own identities, privileges, and power and how they impact your engagement with Stat 100

## Code of Conduct

I expect all members of STAT 100 to make participation a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.  

I expect everyone to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming diverse, inclusive, and healthy community of learners.  You can contribute to a positive learning environment by demonstrating empathy and kindness, being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences, and giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.


This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html), version 2.0.

## Language: `R`-This, `R`-That, `R`-...

Three `R` Things:

--

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width= "15%", out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Rlogo.png")
```

<br>

`R` is the name of the programming language.


--

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width= "15%", out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/RStudio.png")
```

<br>

 `RStudio` is the pretty interface.

<br>

--

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width= "15%", out.extra='style="float:left; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rmarkdown.png")
```

<br>

`RMarkdown` is the type of file where we will record all of our work (code, output, narrative).

<br>

---

class: , center, middle

## Let's Get Started with `R`!

## First step: Navigate to the class Canvas site.


---

## Accessing the RStudio Server



```{r  out.width = "95%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/raccess.001.jpeg")
```

* First time may take a while.

## Main Components of RStudio Lay-Out

### Main Components of RStudio Lay-Out

* Sideways carrot called **prompt**.

* Let's try it:

**Environment**

* Lists items stored in your session.

* Will add some items soon!

]]]

--


.pull-left[.fullish-width[.content-box-yellow[

**Files et. al.**

* **Files**: Accesses files in your own directory and the shared directory `shared_data`.

* **Plots**: Contains graphs we create.

* **Packages**: Installs and loads packages.

* **Help**: Displays help files.

]]]


---

##Accessing Course Materials 

* All `R` related course materials will be stored in the `shared_data` folder in the **Files** tab.

* You can access shared files but **you must move the files to your home directory** before you edit and save them.

* Let's practice that now with `introRMarkdown.Rmd` which can be found in `shared_data/stat100/handouts`.

* Steps:
    + Step 1: Click on the `shared_data`, then `stat100`, then `handouts`.
    + Step 2: Click on "introRMarkdown".  It should open in the upper lefthand window.
    + Step 5: Go to the top left of the window and click on File > Save as...
    + Step 6: Click on "Home".
    + Step 7: (Only do this once) Click on **New Folder** and call it "handouts". Hit "Ok".
    + Step 8: Then hit Save.  Now the file is saved in your directory and you are ready to work on it.
