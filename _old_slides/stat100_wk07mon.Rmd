### One Last Point on Linear Regression (for now)

Linear regression is a flexible class of models that allow for:

* Both quantitative and categorical explanatory variables.


* Multiple explanatory variables.


* Curved relationships between the response variable and the explanatory variable.


* BUT the response variable is **quantitative**.



**Form of the Model:**



$$ 
\begin{align}
y &= \beta_o + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \cdots + \beta_p \epsilon_p + \epsilon
\end{align}
$$

#### But why is it called **linear** regression if the model also works for curved relationship??

```{r}

#### Distinguishing between the population and the sample

.pull-left[

* **Parameters**: 
    + Based on the **population**
    + Unknown then if don't have data on the whole population
    + EX: $\beta_o$ and $\beta_1$
    + EX: $\mu$ = population mean

* **Statistics**: 
    + Based on the **sample** data
    + Known
    + Usually estimate a population parameter

### Quantifying Our Uncertainty 

`R` has been giving us uncertainty estimates:

.pull-left[

```{r polls, fig.show = 'hide'}
Pollster08 <- 
  read_csv("~/shared_data/stat100/data/Pollster08.csv")

ggplot(Pollster08, aes(x = Days,
                       y = Margin, 
                       color = factor(Charlie))) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

```


]

.pull-right[


```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(knitr::fig_chunk("polls", "png"))
```

]

---

### Quantifying Our Uncertainty 

`R` has been giving us uncertainty estimates:

```{r}
modPoll <- lm(Margin ~ Days*factor(Charlie), data = Pollster08)
library(moderndive)
get_regression_table(modPoll)
```

### Quantifying Our Uncertainty 

The [news and journal articles](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/12/17/more-u-s-homeowners-say-they-are-considering-home-solar-panels/) are also giving us uncertainty estimates:


.pull-left[

```{r  out.width = "65%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("img/solar_panels.png") 
```

.pull-right[


```{r  out.width = "85%", echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}

### Quantifying Our Uncertainty

### Statistical Inference

**Goal**: Draw conclusions about the population based on the sample.

--

**Main Flavors**

&rarr; Estimating numerical quantities (parameters).

--

&rarr; Testing conjectures.

---

### Estimation

**Goal**: Estimate a (population) parameter.  

--

Best guess?  

&rarr; The corresponding (sample) statistic 

--

**Example**: Are GIFs just another way for people to share videos of their pets?

<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/MCfhrrNN1goH6" width="280" height="240" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/easy-ear-MCfhrrNN1goH6">via GIPHY</a></p>

--

Want to estimate the proportion of GIFs that feature animals.

---

### Estimation

**Key Question**: How accurate is the statistic as an estimate of the parameter?

--

**Helpful Sub-Question**: If we take many samples, how much would the statistic vary from sample to sample?

--

Need two new concepts:

--

* The **sampling variability** of a statistic

--

* The **sampling distribution** of a statistic

## Sampling Distribution of a Statistic

Steps to Construct an (Approximate) Sampling Distribution:

1. Decide on a sample size, $n$.

--

2. Randomly select a sample of size $n$ from the population.

--

3. Compute the sample statistic.

--

4.  Put the sample back in.

--

5. Repeat Steps 2 - 4 many (1000+) times.

## Sampling Distribution of a Statistic

.pull-left[

* Center? Shape?

* Spread?
    + Standard error = standard deviation of the statistic

**What happens to the center/spread/shape as we increase the sample size?**


**What happens to the center/spread/shape if the true parameter changes?**
