    + Center
    + Spread/variability

* Consider measures for **summarizing** categorical data


]

## But First... Server Issues

--

#### Try to not conflate the (so far) unreliable **FAS OnDemand Server** with `R` and `RStudio`.

--

#### `R` and `RStudio` are great tools for extracting knowledge from data!

--

#### There will be a learning curve on how to use these tools but it shouldn't have involved navigating an unstable interfacing medium.

## Load Necessary Packages

`dplyr` is part of the `tidyverse` collection of data science packages.

```{r, message=TRUE}
# Load necessary packages
library(tidyverse)
```

## Import the [Data](https://data.cambridgema.gov/Transportation-Planning/Eco-Totem-Broadway-Bicycle-Count/q8v9-mcfg)

```{r, cache = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
bike_counter <- read_csv("https://data.cambridgema.gov/api/views/q8v9-mcfg/rows.csv")

# Inspect the data
glimpse(bike_counter)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
bike_counter <- select(bike_counter, -DateTime,
                       -Westbound, -Eastbound, -Day)

## Summarizing Data

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
knitr::kable(bike_counter[1000:1006,]) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("responsive", "bordered", "striped"))

* Hard to do by eyeballing a spreadsheet with many rows!

##  Summarizing Data Visually

.pull-left[

```{r, echo = FALSE}

ggplot(data = bike_counter, mapping = aes(x = Total)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "slateblue4", color = "ghostwhite")

For a quantitative variable, want to answer:

## Summarizing Quantitative Variables

For a quantitative variable, want to answer:



* What is an average value?



* What is the trend/shape of the variable?


* How much variation is there from case to case?

--

Need to learn some **summary statistics**: Numerical values computed based on the observed cases.

---

## Measures of Center

.pull-left[
**Mean: average of all the observations**


* $n$ = Number of cases (sample size)
* $x_i$ = value of the i-th observation
* Denote by $\bar{x}$

$$
\bar{x}  = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i
$$

## Measures of Variability

* In addition to the sample standard deviation and the sample variance, there is the Interquartile Range (IQR): 

$$
\mbox{IQR} = \mbox{Q}_3 - \mbox{Q}_1
$$

* Which is more robust to outliers, the IQR or $s$?

* Which is more commonly used, the IQR or $s$?

### Data Wrangling: Transformations done on the data

--

**Why wrangle the data?**

--

.pull-left[

To **summarize** the data.

]


.pull-right[

&#8594; To compute the mean and standard deviation of the bike counts.

]

--

.pull-left[

To **drop** missing values.  (Need to be careful here!)

]

.pull-right[

&#8594; In your P-Set 2, `geom_histogram()` is dropping NAs before creating the graph.

]


--

.pull-left[

To **filter** to a particular subset of the data.

]

.pull-right[

&#8594; To subset the bike counts data to 2 days in July of 2019.

]

--

.pull-left[

To **collapse** the categories of a categorical variable.



]

.pull-right[

&#8594; To go from 86 dog breeds to just mixed or single breed.

]


--

.pull-left[

To **arrange** the data to make it easier to display.

]

.pull-right[

&#8594; To sort from most common dog name to least common.

]

--

.pull-left[

To fix how `R` **stores** a variable.

]

.pull-right[

&#8594; I converted `Day` from a character variable/vector to a date variable/vector.

]

OR, to **combine** data frames when information about your cases is stored in multiple places!


---

## Data Joins

* Often in the data analysis workflow, we have more than one data source, which means more than one dataframe, and we want to combine these dataframes.

--

* Need principled way to combine.
    + Need a **key** that links two dataframes together.

--

* These multiple dataframes are called **relational data**.

> .mustard[BLS Mission]: "Measures labor market activity, working conditions, price changes, and productivity in the U.S. economy to support public and private decision making."

--

* Household survey but data are also collected on individuals
    + fmli: household data
    + memi: household member-level data

```{r}
#Read in data with readr package
library(tidyverse)
fmli <- read_csv("~/shared_data/stat100/data/fmli.csv", 
                 na = c("NA", "."))
memi <- read_csv("~/shared_data/stat100/data/memi.csv", 
                 na = c("NA", "."))

```

* Want variables on the **principal earner** to be added to the household data

---

## CE Data

* Key variable(s)?

```{r}
glimpse(fmli)
```

---


## CE Data

* Key variables?

```{r}
glimpse(memi)
```

---

## CE Data

* Key variables?
    + Problem with class?

```{r}
class(fmli$NEWID)
class(memi$NEWID)
class(fmli$PRINEARN)
class(memi$MEMBNO)
```

---

## CE Data

* Key variables?
    + Problem with class?

```{r}
fmli <- mutate(fmli, PRINEARN = as.integer(PRINEARN))
class(fmli$PRINEARN)
class(memi$MEMBNO)
```

---

## CE Data

* Want to add columns of `memi` to `fmli` that correspond to the principal earner's memi data
    + What type of join is that?

---

## The World of Joins

* **Mutating joins**: Add new variables to one dataset from matching observations in another.
    + `left_join()` (and `right_join()`)
    + `inner_join()`
    + `full_join()`

* There are also *filtering* joins but we won't cover those today.    

---

## Example Dataframes

Here I created the data frames by hand.

```{r}
staff <- data.frame(member = c("Prof McConville", "Lety", "Kate",
                               "Thor", "Mally", "Dylan", "Nick",
                               "Khalila"),
                 Year = c(2006, 2024, 2023, 2025, 2025, 2025, 2025, 2025),
                 Food = c("tikka masala", "chicken wings", "sushi",
                          "Sun HUDS Brunch", "quesadillas",
                          "shepards pie", "burgers", "salad"),
                 Neighborhood = c("Somerville", "River Central", "Quad", 
                                  "River East", "River Central",
                                  "Quad", "River Central", 
                                  "River West"))
housing <- data.frame(Neighborhoods = c("Yard", "River East",
                                        "River Central", "River West",
                                        "Quad"),
                      Steps = c(75, 600, 450, 1100, 1200))
```


---

## Example Dataframes


```{r}
staff
housing
```

---

## `left_join()`

```{r, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE, error = TRUE}
staff_new <- left_join(staff, housing)
staff_new
```

---

## `left_join()`

```{r}
staff_new <- left_join(staff, housing,
                       by = c("Neighborhood" = "Neighborhoods"))
staff_new
```


---

## `inner_join()`

```{r}
staff_housing <- inner_join(staff, housing, 
                            by = c("Neighborhood" = "Neighborhoods"))
staff_housing
```


---

## `full_join()`

```{r}
staff_housing <- full_join(staff, housing, 
                            by = c("Neighborhood" = "Neighborhoods"))
staff_housing
```


---

## Back to our Example

* What kind of join do we want for the Consumer Expenditure data?
    + Want to add columns of `memi` to `fmli` that correspond to the principal earner's memi data

---

## Look at the Possible Joins

```{r, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE}
left_join(fmli, memi) 
```

---

## Look at the Possible Joins

* Be careful.  This erroneous example made my R crash!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
left_join(fmli, memi, by = c("PRINEARN" = "MEMBNO"))
```

.pull-left[

```{r}
count(fmli, PRINEARN)

```

]

.pull-right[

```{r}

count(memi, MEMBNO)
```

]

---

## Look at the Possible Joins

```{r}
left_join(fmli, memi, by = c("NEWID" = "NEWID",
                             "PRINEARN" = "MEMBNO"))
```

---

## Look at the Possible Joins

```{r}
inner_join(fmli, memi, by = c("NEWID" = "NEWID",
                              "PRINEARN" = "MEMBNO"))
```

* Why does this give us the same answer as `left_join` for this situation?

---

## Look at the Possible Joins

```{r}
full_join(fmli, memi, by = c("NEWID" = "NEWID",
                             "PRINEARN" = "MEMBNO"))
```

---

## Joining Tips

```{r}
fmli <- left_join(fmli, memi, by = c("NEWID" = "NEWID",
                                     "PRINEARN" = "MEMBNO"))
```

* FIRST: conceptualize for yourself what you think you want the final dataset to look like!
* Check initial dimensions and final dimensions.
* Use variable names when joining even if they are the same.
