### [What do we mean by confidence?](http://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/2021/confsim/ConfSim.html)


* Confidence level = success rate of the method under **repeated sampling**



* How do I know if my ONE CI successfully contains the true value of the parameter?



* As we increase the **confidence level**, what happens to the width of the interval?



* As we increase the **sample size**, what happens to the width of the interval?



* As we increase the **number of bootstrap samples** we take, what happens to the width of the interval?

## Interpreting Confidence Intervals

#### Example: Estimating average household income before taxes in the US

.pull-left[

SE Method Formula: 

$$
\mbox{statistic} \pm{\mbox{ME}}
$$

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(infer)
ce <- read_csv("~/shared_data/stat100/data/ce.csv")
summarize(ce, meanFINCBTAX = mean(FINCBTAX))
bootstrap_dist <- ce %>%
  specify(response = FINCBTAX) %>%
  generate(reps =  1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "mean")
summarize(bootstrap_dist, ME = 2*sd(stat), lower = 62480 - ME, upper = 62480 + ME)
```

*"The margin of [sampling] error can be described as the 'penalty' in precision for not talking to everyone in a given population. It describes the range that an answer likely falls between if the survey had reached everyone in a population, instead of just a sample of that population."* -- Courtney Kennedy, Director of Survey Research at Pew Research Center


CI = interval of **plausible** values for the **parameter**

#### Safe interpretation:


I am P% confident that {insert what the parameter represents in context}  is between {insert lower bound} and {insert upper bound}.

## Example: Does Extrasensory Perception (ESP) exist?

.pull-left[

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.cap = "Daryl Bem and Ben Honorton"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Bem_Honorton.png")
```

]

--

.pull-right[

Bem and Honorton conducted extrasensory perception  studies:



* A "sender" randomly chooses an object out of 4 possible objects and sends that information to a "receiver".
* The "receiver" is then given a set of 4 possible objects and they must decide which one most resembles the object sent to them.

Out of 329 trials, the "receivers" correctly identified the object 106 times.

]

---

## ESP Example

Let's consider the following questions:

--

a. If ESP does not exist and the "receivers" are guessing, how often would we expect them to be correct?

--

<br> <br>

b. For each sample (set of 329 trials), do we expect the proportion of correct guesses to be equal?  Why or why not?

--



<br> <br>

c. Is it possible to randomly guess correctly 106 out of 329 times (i.e., 32% of the time)?

--

<br> <br>



d. How unusual is it to guess correctly 106 out of 329 times if ESP doesn't exist?

--

To help us answer d., we need a **sampling distribution** for the sample proportion where **we assume the "receivers" were purely guessing!**

## Sampling Distribution of a Statistic

.pull-left[

**Steps for (Approximate) Distribution:**

(1) Decide on a sample size, $n$.

(2) Randomly select a sample of size $n$ from the population.

(3) Compute the sample statistic.

(4)  Put the sample back in.

(5) Repeat Steps (2) - (4) many (1000+) times.

In pairs:

* Decide who is going to be the sender and who is going to be the receiver.

* **Sender:** Think of one of these images.

* **Receiver:** Guess which image the sender was thinking of.  

* Now switch roles and do it again!  

* Once you have both played each role, each person should add a tally mark on the chalkboard.

## Do Harvardians Have ESP?
