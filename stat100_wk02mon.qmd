### ChatGPT Strengths

-   Very dangerous **automated** data analysis.
    -   Hard to determine if its conclusions are based on the data at hand or the data the large language model was built on.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Stat 100 Goals

-   Learn that data analysis is a **humanistic** endeavor where context drives the data analysis process.
    -   Still need to be careful about biases and data quality.
:::
:::

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   A **personalized** tutor (especially for coding) that tells you the answers.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   For you to **learn** to code and to **think** statistically.
    -   The Stat 100 Teaching Team will help support that learning.
:::
:::

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Instantly generating written blurbs.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   For you to learn how to communicate about your data work and data ethics.
:::
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## My View on the (Current) Role of ChatGPT in Data Work

-   To generate code to realize **fully conceived** ideas that aren't novel or advanced.

-   **Seasoned data scientist** can/should:

    -   Verify the correctness of the code.
    -   Identify any assumptions or defaults ChatGPT is employing.
    -   Run the code in `R` and draw conclusions based on the data to reduce risk of perpetuating biases that exist in ChatGPT's training data.

-   So, ChatGPT might be useful to you **after** Stat 100 but will be detrimental to your learning **during** Stat 100.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## AI Policy for Stat 100

> While A.I. tools, such as ChatGPT, are being used to generate code and analyze data, goals of this course are to develop your own ability to write code and to thoughtfully extract knowledge from data. Therefore, we expect that all work students submit for this course will be their own. This includes code, written work, and oral assessments. We specifically forbid the use of ChatGPT or any other generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools at all stages of the work process, including preliminary ones, unless the assignment specifically states that it is allowed. Violations of this policy will be considered academic misconduct. We draw your attention to the fact that different classes at Harvard could implement different AI policies, and it is the student's responsibility to conform to expectations for each course.

> The goal of this policy is not to lessen your access to support but to ensure we are achieving the learning objectives of the course. Please see the **Avenues for Help** section of the syllabus for ways to get support in Stat 100.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Engagement

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
<br> <br>

![](img/jessica-knowlden--AvRbJOVUKA-unsplash.jpg){width="90%" fig-align="center"}

-   Being **actively present** is key.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   During lecture and section, remove distractions.
    -   When we are on our computers, close email, social media, news, etc.
    -   If you will be using a computer/tablet for taking notes, please sit outside the technology-free zone (first 6 rows of the middle section) **starting next lecture** so as not to distract classmates.
    -   Hide your phone.
-   I have high expectations but know that all of you (regardless of your stats or computing background) have the ability to meet them.
:::
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Identity and the Classroom

-   Acknowledge that my perspectives and experiences have shaped how I teach this course and how I approach my data work

-   Some of my identities place me in dominant groups while others in marginalized groups

-   Strive to bring examples and scholarly contributions that value knowledge from folks with a wide variety of identities

-   Strive to be a open listener and recognize your thoughts as a generous offer and a vote of confidence in my ability to hear and be transformed by you

-   Ask that you reflect on your own identities, privileges, and power and how they impact your engagement with Stat 100

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Code of Conduct

> We expect all members of STAT 100 to make participation a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

> We expect everyone to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming diverse, inclusive, and healthy community of learners. You can contribute to a positive learning environment by demonstrating empathy and kindness, being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences, and giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html), version 2.0.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Ways to Get Support

-   **Attend, attend, attend** when you don't feel ill

-   **Participate** in the Stat 100 Slack Workspace
