Therefore, we expect that all work students submit for this course will be their own. This includes code, written work, and oral assessments. We specifically forbid the use of ChatGPT or any other generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools at all stages of the work process, including preliminary ones, unless the assignment specifically states that it is allowed. Violations of this policy will be considered academic misconduct. We draw your attention to the fact that different classes at Harvard could implement different AI policies, and it is the student’s responsibility to conform to expectations for each course.\n\n\nThe goal of this policy is not to lessen your access to support but to ensure we are achieving the learning objectives of the course. Please see the Avenues for Help section of the syllabus for ways to get support in Stat 100."
