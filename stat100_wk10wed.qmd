XXX: What we are learning in Stat 100


---

### Hypothesis Testing: Decisions, Decisions

Once you get to the end of a hypothesis test you make one of two decisions:

* P-value is small.
    + I have evidence for $H_a$. Reject $H_o$.
* P-value is not small.
    + I don't have evidence for $H_a$. Fail to reject $H_o$.

::: fragment

Sometimes we make the correct decision.  Sometimes we make a mistake.  

:::

---

### Hypothesis Testing: Decisions, Decisions

Let's create a table of potential outcomes.

<br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <br> <br> 




$\alpha$ = prob of Type I error **under repeated sampling** = prob reject $H_o$ when it is true


$\beta$ = prob of Type II error **under repeated sampling** = prob fail to reject $H_o$ when $H_a$ is true.


---

### Hypothesis Testing: Decisions, Decisions

Typically set $\alpha$ level beforehand.



Use $\alpha$ to determine "small" for a p-value.


::: nonincremental

*  P-value ~~is~~ ~~small~~  $< \alpha$.
    + I have evidence for $H_a$. Reject $H_o$.


* P-value ~~is~~ ~~not~~ ~~small~~  $\geq \alpha$.
    + I don't have evidence for $H_a$. Fail to reject $H_o$.

:::

---

### Hypothesis Testing: Decisions, Decisions

**Question**: How do I select $\alpha$?


* Will depend on the convention in your field.


* Want a small $\alpha$ and a small $\beta$. But they are related.  
    + **The smaller $\alpha$ is the larger $\beta$ will be.**

* Choose a lower $\alpha$ (e.g., 0.01, 0.001) when the Type I error is worse and a higher $\alpha$ (e.g., 0.1) when the Type II error is worse.


* Can't easily compute $\beta$.  Why?


* One more important term:
    + **Power** = probability reject $H_o$ when the alternative is true.

---

### Example

Suppose we have a baseball player who has been a 0.250 career hitter who suddenly improves to be a 0.333 hitter.  He wants a raise but needs to convince his manager that he has genuinely improved.  The manager offers to examine his performance in 20 at-bats.

### Computing Power

::: nonincremental

1. Generate a null distribution:

:::

```{r}
#| output-location: column

# Create a dummy dataset with the correct sample size
dat <- data.frame(at_bats = c(rep("hit", 80), 
                              rep("miss", 20)))


null <- dat %>%
  specify(response = at_bats, success = "hit") %>%
  hypothesize(null = "point", p = 0.25) %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "draw") %>%
  calculate(stat = "prop")

ggplot(data = null, mapping = aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 27, color = "white")

```

---

### Computing Power

::: nonincremental

2. Determine the "critical value(s)" where $\alpha = 0.05$

:::

```{r}
#| output-location: column
quantile(null$stat, 0.95)


ggplot(data = null, mapping = aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 40, color = "white") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = quantile(null$stat, 0.95),
             size = 2,
             color = "turquoise4")
```


---

### Computing Power

::: nonincremental

3. Construct the alternative distribution.

:::

```{r}
#| output-location: column
alt <- dat %>%
  specify(response = at_bats, success = "hit") %>%
  hypothesize(null = "point", p = 0.333) %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "draw") %>%
  calculate(stat = "prop") %>%
  mutate(dist = "Alternative")

ggplot(data = alt, mapping = aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 27, color = "white") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = quantile(null$stat, 0.95),
             size = 2,
             color = "turquoise4")
```

---

### Computing Power

::: nonincremental

4. Find the probability of the critical value or more extreme under the **alternative distribution**.

:::

```{r}
alt %>%
  summarize(power = mean(stat > quantile(null$stat, 0.95)))
```


---

## Thoughts on Power

* What aspects of the test did the player actually have control over?



* Why is it easier to set $\alpha$ than to set $\beta$ or power?



* Considering power before collecting data is very important!

* The danger of under-powered studies
    + EX: Turning right at a red light
