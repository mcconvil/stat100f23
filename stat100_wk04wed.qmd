### Getting Help with `R`

![](img/rhelp.001.jpeg)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Novices asking the internet for `R` help = `r emo::ji("cold_sweat")`

-   **Get help from the Stat 100 teaching staff or classmates!**

    -   Will start p-sets in section each week.
    -   Use the Slack `#q-and-a` channel.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Get help **early** before `r emo::ji("rage")` sets in!
    -   Be prepared for missing commas and quotes, capitalization issues, etc...
-   Later in the semester, will learn tricks for effectively getting `R` help online.

###  When to Get Help

`r emo::ji("cry")` *"I have no idea how to do this problem."* 

::: fragment

&rarr; Ask someone to point you to an similar example from the lecture, handouts, and guides.  

::: 
::: fragment

&rarr; Talk it through with someone on the Teaching Team or another Stat 100 student so together we can verbalize the process of going from Q to A.

:::

<br>

::: fragment


`r emo::ji("rage")` *"I am getting a weird error but really think my code is correct/on the right track/matches the examples from class."*

::: 
::: fragment

&rarr; It is time for a second pair of eyes.  Don't stare at the error for over 10 minutes.

::: 

<br>

::: fragment

`r emo::ji("star-struck")` And lots of other times too! `r emo::ji("grimace")`

###  When to Get Help


Remember:

::: fragment

&rarr; Struggling is part of learning.

:::
::: fragment

&rarr; But let us help you ensure it is a **productive** struggle.

&rarr; Struggling does NOT mean you are bad at stats!

## Load Necessary Packages

`dplyr` is part of this collection of data science packages.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data Setting: [Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Consumer Expenditure Survey](https://www.bls.gov/cex/)

**BLS Mission**: "Measures labor market activity, working conditions, price changes, and productivity in the U.S. economy to support public and private decision making."

**Data**: Last quarter of the 2016 BLS Consumer Expenditure Survey.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

ce_raw <- read_csv("data/fmli.csv", 
                 na = c("NA", "."))
glimpse(ce_raw)
```

## CE Data

::: {.nonincremental}

-   **Household** survey but data are also collected on **individuals**
    -   `fmli`: household data
    -   `memi`: household member-level data
    
:::    

```{r}
fmli <- read_csv("data/fmli.csv", 
                 na = c("NA", ".")) %>%
  select(NEWID, PRINEARN, FINCBTAX,
         BLS_URBN, HIGH_EDU)
memi <- read_csv("data/memi.csv", 
                 na = c("NA", ".")) %>%
  select(NEWID, MEMBNO, AGE, SEX, EARNTYPE)

fmli <- mutate(fmli, PRINEARN = as.integer(PRINEARN))
```

-   Want to add variables on the **principal earner** from the member data frame to the household data frame

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Smaller Sets of CE Data

::: columns
::: {.column width="\"50%"}
```{r}
fmli_small <- filter(fmli, NEWID %in% c("03530051",
                                        "03327224",
                                        "03324324",

memi_small
```
:::
:::


## Look at the Possible Joins

```{r}
full_join(fmli_small, memi_small, join_by("NEWID" == "NEWID", "PRINEARN" == "MEMBNO"))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Joining Tips

```{r}
fmli <- left_join(fmli, memi, join_by("NEWID" == "NEWID", "PRINEARN" == "MEMBNO"))
```

-   FIRST: conceptualize for yourself what you think you want the final dataset to look like!
-   Check initial dimensions and final dimensions.
-   Use variable names when joining even if they are the same.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Naming Wrangled Data

Should I name my new dataframe `ce` or `ce1`?

-   *My* answer:
    -   Is your new dataset structurally different? If so, give it a **new name**.
    -   Are you removing values you will need for a future analysis within the same document? If so, give it a **new name**.
    -   Are you just adding to or cleaning the data? If so, then **write over** the original.

# Live Coding

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Sage Advice from ModernDive

<br>

> "Crucial: Unless you are very confident in what you are doing, it is worthwhile not starting to code right away. Rather, first sketch out on paper all the necessary data wrangling steps not using exact code, but rather high-level pseudocode that is informal yet detailed enough to articulate what you are doing. This way you won't confuse what you are trying to do (the algorithm) with how you are going to do it (writing dplyr code)."

## Motivating Our Discussion of Data Collection

![](img/twitter-study-design.png){width="50%" fig-align="center"}
---

##  Who are the data supposed to represent?


![](img/week4.002.jpeg){width="75%" fig-align="center"}


**Key questions:**

+ What evidence is there that the data are **representative**?
+ Who is present?  Who is absent?
+ Who is overrepresented?  Who is underrepresented?

## Sampling Bias

![](img/sampling.001.jpeg){width="75%" fig-align="center"}


**Sampling bias**: When the sampled units are **systematically different** from the non-sampled units on the variables of interest.


---

### Sampling Bias Example

The **Literary Digest** was a political magazine that correctly predicted the presidential outcomes from 1916 to 1932.  In 1936, they conducted the most extensive (to that date) public opinion poll.  They mailed questionnaires to over 10 million people (about 1/3 of US households) whose names and addresses they obtained from telephone books and vehicle registration lists. 



**Population of Interest**:

<br>

**Sample**:

**Sampling bias**:

## Random Sampling

Use random sampling (a random mechanism for selecting cases from the population) to remove sampling bias.


#### Types of random sampling

* Simple random sampling

* Cluster sampling

* Stratified random sampling

* Systematic sampling

### FIA: Systematic Random Sampling

This is FIA's **actual** sampling design (okay, slightly simplified).

- Break the landscape up into equally sized plots (~1 acre).
- Number each plot from 1 to 6,755,200.
- Use a **random** mechanism to pick starting point.  Then sample about once every 6000 acres.

### NHANES Sampling Design

* **Stage 1**: US is stratified by geography and distribution of minority populations.  Counties are randomly selected within each stratum.

* **Stage 2**: From the sampled counties, city blocks are randomly selected. (City blocks are clusters.)

* **Stage 3**: From sampled city blocks, households are randomly selected. (Households are clusters.)

* **Stage 4**: From sampled households, people are randomly selected.  For the sampled households, a mobile health vehicle goes to the house and medical professionals take the necessary measurements.

##  Responsibilities to Research Subjects
