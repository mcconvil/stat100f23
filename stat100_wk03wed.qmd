## Announcements

-   With COVID working its way through campus right now, make sure to check the  [Sections](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10wScs6Z7hpYK16NnmyU_q8DlKn4iF_U3dB19a-ts0g0/edit?usp=sharing) spreadsheet and the [Office hours](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eGlvDVPFceat2xck-y0r_rhrXPZBxjkW-rmIWFqg68w/edit?usp=sharing) spreadsheet for updates!



------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals for Today

::: columns
::: {.column width="\"50%"}

* Consider measures for **summarizing** quantitative data
    + Center
    + Spread/variability

* Consider measures for **summarizing** categorical data



:::

::: {.column width="\"50%"}


* Define **data wrangling**

* Learn to do data **joins**

* Learn to use functions in the `dplyr` package for both data summarization and data joins!

## Load Necessary Packages

![](img/dplyr.png){width="15%" fig-align="center"}

`dplyr` is part of this collection of data science packages.

```{r}
#| message: true
#| warning: true
# Load necessary packages
library(tidyverse)
```

---

## Import the [Data](https://data.cambridgema.gov/Transportation-Planning/Eco-Totem-Broadway-Bicycle-Count/q8v9-mcfg)



```{r}
july_2019 <- read_csv("data/july_2019.csv")

# Inspect the data
glimpse(july_2019)
```

---

## Summarizing Data

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
knitr::kable(july_2019[25:32,]) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("responsive", "bordered", "striped")) 
```


* Hard to do by eyeballing a spreadsheet with many rows!

---

##  Summarizing Data Visually

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Create histogram
ggplot(data = july_2019, mapping = aes(x = Total)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "slateblue4", color = "ghostwhite") +
  facet_wrap(~Occasion, ncol = 1)

```

:::


::: {.column width="50%"}

<br>

For a quantitative variable, want to answer:



* What is an **average** value?



* What is the **trend/shape** of the variable?



* How much **variation** is there from case to case?

:::

:::

::: fragment

Need to learn key **summary statistics**: Numerical values computed based on the observed cases.

:::

---

## Measures of Center

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Mean**: Average of all the observations


* $n$ = Number of cases (sample size)
* $x_i$ = value of the i-th observation
* Denote by $\bar{x}$

$$
\bar{x}  = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i
$$
```{r}
# Test out on first 6 values
head(july_2019$Total)
```


:::

::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}

Compute with a `dplyr` function:

```{r}
summarize(july_2019, mean_bikes = mean(Total))
```


:::
:::


---

## Measures of Center

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Median**: Middle value

* Half of the data falls below the median
* Denote by $m$
* If $n$ is even, then it is the average of the middle two values


```{r}
# Test out on first 6 values
head(july_2019$Total)
```


:::

::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}

Compute with a `dplyr` function:

```{r}
summarize(july_2019, median_bikes = median(Total))
```


:::
:::

## Measures of Center

::: columns

::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}


Why is the mean larger than the median?

```{r}
summarize(july_2019, mean_bikes = mean(Total),
          median_bikes = median(Total))
```



:::

::: {.column .fragment width="50%"}


```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Create histogram
ggplot(data = july_2019, mapping = aes(x = Total)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "slateblue4", color = "ghostwhite") 
```

## Computing Measures of Center by Groups



**Question**: Were there more bikes, on average, for Fourth of July or for the normal Thursday?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#| fig-width: 10

# Create histogram
ggplot(data = july_2019, mapping = aes(x = Total)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "slateblue4", color = "ghostwhite") +
  facet_wrap(~Occasion, ncol = 1)

```

---

## Computing Measures of Center by Groups

Handy `dplyr` function: `group_by()`

```{r}
july_2019_grouped <- group_by(july_2019, Occasion)
july_2019_grouped
```


---

## Computing Measures of Center by Groups

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}

Compute summary statistics on the grouped data frame:

```{r}
summarize(july_2019_grouped, mean_bikes = mean(Total),
          median_bikes = median(Total))
```



:::

::: {.column width="50%"}


```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Create histogram
ggplot(data = july_2019, mapping = aes(x = Total)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "slateblue4", color = "ghostwhite") +
  facet_wrap(~Occasion, ncol = 1)
```

## Measures of Variability

* Want a statistic that captures how much observations **deviate** from the mean


::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}

* Find how much each observation deviates from the mean.
* Compute the average of the deviations.

$$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})
$$
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
# Test out on first 6 values
head(july_2019$Total)

## Measures of Variability

* Want a statistic that captures how much observations **deviate** from the mean


::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}

Here is my **NEW** proposal:

* Find how much each observation deviates from the mean.
* Compute the average of the **squared** deviations.

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
# Test out on first 6 values
head(july_2019$Total)

## Measures of Variability

* Want a statistic that captures how much observations **deviate** from the mean


::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}

Here is my **ACTUAL** formula:

* Find how much each observation deviates from the mean.
* Compute the (nearly) average of the **squared** deviations.
* Called **sample variance** $s^2$.

$$
s^2 = \frac{1}{n - 1} \sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2
$$

:::


::: {.column width="50%"}

Compute with a `dplyr` function:

```{r}
summarize(july_2019, var_bikes = var(Total))
```

## Measures of Variability

* Want a statistic that captures how much observations **deviate** from the mean


::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}


* Find how much each observation deviates from the mean.
* Compute the (nearly) average of the **squared** deviations.
* Called **sample variance** $s^2$.
* The square root of the sample variance is called the **sample standard deviation** $s$.

$$
s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n - 1} \sum_{i = 1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}
$$

:::


::: {.column width="50%"}

Compute with a `dplyr` function:

```{r}
summarize(july_2019, var_bikes = var(Total),
          sd_bikes = sd(Total))
```


:::
:::

---

## Measures of Variability

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}

* In addition to the sample standard deviation and the sample variance, there is the sample **interquartile range** (IQR): 

$$
\mbox{IQR} = \mbox{Q}_3 - \mbox{Q}_1
$$

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

Compute with a `dplyr` function:

```{r}
summarize(july_2019, iqr_bikes = IQR(Total))
```


:::
:::

---

## Comparing Measures of Variability

* Which is more robust to outliers, the IQR or $s$?

* Which is more commonly used, the IQR or $s$?

```{r}
summarize(july_2019_grouped, sd_bikes = sd(Total),
          iqr_bikes = IQR(Total))
```
