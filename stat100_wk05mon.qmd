# Detour: Data Ethics

---

### Data Ethics

> "Good statistical practice is fundamentally based on transparent assumptions, reproducible results, and valid interpretations." -- Committee on Professional Ethics of the American Statistical Association (ASA)



The ASA has created ["Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice"](https://www.amstat.org/ASA/Your-Career/Ethical-Guidelines-for-Statistical-Practice.aspx)

::: fragment

&rarr; These guidelines are for EVERYONE doing statistical work. 

:::

::: fragment

&rarr; There are ethical decisions at all steps of the Data Analysis Process.


:::
::: fragment

&rarr; We will periodically refer to specific guidelines throughout this class.

::: 

::: fragment

> "Above all, professionalism in statistical practice presumes the goal of advancing knowledge while avoiding harm; using statistics in pursuit of unethical ends is inherently unethical."

:::

---


##  Responsibilities to Research Subjects


> "The ethical statistician protects and respects the rights and interests of human and animal subjects at all stages of their involvement in a project. This includes respondents to the census or to surveys, those whose data are contained in administrative records, and subjects of physically or psychologically invasive research."

---

###  Responsibilities to Research Subjects

Why do you think the `Age` variable maxes out at 80?

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 0.35}
library(tidyverse)
library(NHANES)


ggplot(data = NHANES, mapping = aes(x = Age, y = Height)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_smooth(color = "skyblue") +
  labs(title = "NHANES: Age versus Height")
```

::: fragment

> "Protects the privacy and confidentiality of research subjects and data concerning them, whether obtained from the subjects directly, other persons, or existing records."

:::

---

## Detour from Our Detour



```{r points}
#| output-location: column
library(tidyverse)
library(NHANES)

ggplot(data = NHANES, 
       mapping = aes(x = Age,
                     y = Height)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_smooth(color = "skyblue")
```

## Detour from Our Detour



```{r hearts}
#| output-location: column
library(tidyverse)
library(NHANES)
library(emojifont)

NHANES <- mutate(NHANES, 
          heart = fontawesome("fa-heart"))

ggplot(data = NHANES, 
       mapping = aes(x = Age,
                     y = Height,
                     label = heart)) +

## Who are the data supposed to represent?

---

##  Who are the data supposed to represent?

![](img/week4.006.jpeg){width="60%" fig-align="center"}


**Key questions:**

+ What evidence is there that the **respondents** are **representative** of the **population**?
+ Who is present?  Who is absent?
+ Who is overrepresented?  Who is underrepresented?

---

## Nonresponse bias


![](img/sampling.003.jpeg){width="60%" fig-align="center"}

**Nonresponse bias**: The respondents are **systematically** different from the non-respondents for the variables of interest.


---

### Come Back to Literary Digest Example

Of the 10 million people surveyed, more than 2.4 million responded with 57% indicating that they would vote for Republican Alf Landon in the upcoming presidential election instead of the current President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

<br>

**Non-response bias**?


---

## Tackling Nonresponse bias


![](img/sampling.003.jpeg){width="60%" fig-align="center"}


* Use **multiple modes** (mail, phone, in-person) and **multiple attempts** for reaching sampled cases.

* Explore key demographic variables to see how respondents and non-respondents vary.

* Take a survey stats course to learn how to create survey weights to adjust for potential nonresponse bias.

---

## Is Bigger Always Better?

![](img/sampling.004.jpeg){width="60%" fig-align="center"}

For our **Literary Digest Example**, Gallup predicted Roosevelt would win based on a survey of **50,000** people (instead of 2.4 million).

### Big Data Paradox

::: {.column width="80%"}
> "Without taking data quality into account, population inferences with Big Data are subject to a Big Data Paradox: the more the data, the surer we fool ourselves." -- Xiao-Li Meng
:::
:::



**Example:** 

* During Spring of 2021, Delphi-Facebook estimated vaccine uptake at 70% and U.S. Census estimated it at 67%.


* The CDC reported it to be 53%.

::: fragment

And, once we learn about **quantifying uncertainty**, we will see that large sample sizes produce very small measures of uncertainty.

> "If you have the resources, invest in data quality far more than you invest in data quantity. Bad-quality data is essentially wiping out the power you think you have. That’s always been a problem, but it’s magnified now because we have big data." -- Xiao-Li Meng

## Thoughts on Sampling


* **Random** sampling is important to ensure the sample is **representative** of the population.
    + Word we will use: **generalizability**

* Representativeness isn't about **size**.
    + Small random samples will tend to be more representative than large non-random samples.

* However, I bet most samples you will encounter **won't** have arisen from a random mechanism.


* How do we draw conclusions about the population from **non-random samples**?
    + Determinee if your sampled cases (and respondents) are systematically different from the non-sampled cases (and non-respondents) for the variables you care about.
    + Adjust your population of interest.
    + Take a survey stats course to learn how to adjust the sample to make it more representative.

# Now let's shift our discussion to the conclusions we can draw from the sample we have.

---

### Typical Analysis Goals



**Descriptive**: Want to estimate quantities related to the population.

&rarr; *How many trees are in Alaska?*

::: fragment

**Predictive**: Want to predict the value of a variable.

&rarr; *Can I use remotely sensed data to predict forest types in Alaska?*

:::

::: fragment

**Causal**: Want to determine if changes in a variable cause changes in another variable.

&rarr; *Are insects causing the increased mortality rates for pinyon-juniper woodlands?*


:::

---

### Typical Analysis Goals


For these goals will differentiate between the roles of the variables:

* **Response variable**: Variable I want to better understand

* **Explanatory/predictor variables**: Variables I think might explain/predict the response variable

::: fragment

&rarr; *How many trees are in Alaska?*

&rarr; *Can I use remotely sensed data to predict forest types in Alaska?*

&rarr; *Are insects causing the increased mortality rates for pinyon-juniper woodlands?*

:::

---

### Key Mechanism for Causal Goal


**Random assignment**: Cases are randomly assigned to categories of the **explanatory variable**



* If the data were collected using **random assignment**, then can determine if the explanatory variable **causes** changes in the response variable.

::: fragment

**Example**: [COVID Vaccine Trials](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/experimental-coronavirus-vaccine-highly-effective)

To study the effectiveness of the Moderna vaccine (mRNA-1273), researchers carried out a study on over 30,000 adult volunteers with no known previous COVID-19 infection.  Volunteers were randomly assigned to either receive two doses of the vaccine or two shots of saline.  The incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 was 94% lower in those who received the vaccine than those who did not.

:::



**Question**: Why does random assignment allow us to conclude that this vaccine was effective at preventing (early strains of) COVID-19?


---

## Careful with Non-Random Assignment Data

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}

We have data on the number of Methodist ministers in New England and the number of barrels of rum imported into Boston each year.  The data range from 1860 to 1940.

* Should we conclude that ministers drink a lot of rum?  Or maybe that rum drinking encourages church attendance?

:::


::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| echo: false


library(Lock5withR)
ggplot(data = MinistersRum, mapping = aes(x = Ministers, 
                                          y = Rum)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, size = 4, color = "green4")
```


:::
:::



* **Confounding variable**: A third variable that is associated with both the explanatory variable and the response variable.  

* Unclear if the explanatory variable or the confounder (or some other variable) is causing changes in the response.

---

## Causal Inference

* **Spurious relationship**: Two variables are associated but not causally related
    + In the age of big data, lots of good examples [out there](https://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations).

::: fragment

&rarr; *"Correlation does not imply causation."*

::: 

::: fragment

&rarr; *"Correlation does not imply not causation."*

:::

* **Causal inference**: Methods for finding causal relationships even when the data were collected without random assignment.

# Types of Studies

---

## Observational Studies

* A study in which the researchers don't actively control the value of any variable, but simply observe the values as they naturally exist.


* **Example**: Hand washing study
    + To estimate what percent of people in the US wash their hands after using a public restroom, researchers pretended to comb their hair while observing 6000 people in public restrooms throughout the United States. They found that 85% of the people who were observed washed their hands after going to the bathroom.

---

## (Randomized) Experiment

* A study in which the researcher actively controls one or more of the explanatory variables through random assignment.

* **Example**: COVID Trial

* Common features:
    + **Control** group that gets no treatment or a standard treatment
    + **Placebo**: A fake treatment to control for the **placebo effect** where if people believe they are receiving a treatment, they may experience the desired effect regardless of whether the treatment is any good.
    + **Blinding**: When the subjects and/or researchers don't know the explanatory group assignments.

---

## Thoughts on Data Collection Goals


* Random assignment allows you to explore **causal** relationships between your explanatory variables and the predictor variables because the randomization makes the explanatory groups roughly similar.


* How do we draw causal conclusions from studies without random assignment?
    * With extreme care!  Try to **control** for all possible confounding variables.
    + Discuss the associations/correlations you found.  Use domain knowledge to address potentially causal links.
    + Take more stats to learn more about causal inference.

* But also consider the goals of your analysis.  Often the research question isn't causal.

**Bottom Line:** We often have to use imperfect data to make decisions.
